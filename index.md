# Welcome to the CP&G Lab's Web Page
In the ***Cultural Processes and Groups*** (CP&G) lab, at the [school of psychology](https://www.kent.ac.uk/psychology), we are interested in how cultural values and beliefs interact with group dynamics to shape individuals' lives within and across a broad range of different contexts. We use a range of methodologies, including experiments, longitudinal and cross-sectional surveys, and quanlitative analyses. The lab is directed by [Dr Giovanni Travaglino](/about/).

## Main Research Themes
Research in the lab spans a range of different themes and research questions. The main ones are:

* **Political Behavior and Collective Action:** in this theme we examine why and when people engage in collective forms of political action, including demonstrating and protesting, signing petitions or voting. Research in this theme has focussed on events such as Brexit and the Scottish referendum (with [Prof Dominic Abrams](https://www.kent.ac.uk/psychology/people/212/www.kent.ac.uk/psychology/people/212/abrams-dominic) ), or on the cultural bases of radicalization and violent behavior (with [Dr Chanki Moon](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chanki_Moon) ).

* **The psychology of *social banditry*:** Not all dissent can be expressed directly. Groups or individuals may sometimes lack the cultural and 

* Organized crime
* Social Norms and Deviance
* Social Identity

Our research focuses on different geographical areas, including Italy, China, the UK, Korea and the US, and we can collect data from all these sites.

## The Lab Notebook
We keep a [lab notebook](/notebook/), where we propose analyses of recent topics, summarize research conducted by lab members, and comment on new data. Most posts are written in English, and some are in Italian.

### Get in Touch
Undergraduate and postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers who intend to conduct research in these and related areas are welcome to apply to join or visit the lab by [emailing](mailto:g.a.travaglino@kent.ac.uk) the director.
