In the *Cultural Processes and Groups* (CP&G) lab, at the <a href="ps://www.kent.ac.uk/psychology" target="_blank">, we are interested in how cultural values and beliefs interact with group dynamics to shape individuals' lives within and across a broad range of different situations. We use a range of methodologies, including experiments, longitudinal and cross-sectional surveys, and quanlitative analyses. The lab is directed by [Dr Giovanni Travaglino](/about/).

Research in the lab spans a range of different themes and research questions. The main ones are:

* Political Behavior and Collective Action: we examine why and when people engage in collective forms of political action, such as protesting, demonstrating or voting. Research in this theme has focussed on Brexit and the Scottish referendum (with [Prof Dominic Abrams](https://www.kent.ac.uk/psychology/people/212/www.kent.ac.uk/psychology/people/212/abrams-dominic){target="_blank"}, or on the cultural bases of radicalization and violent behavior (with [Dr Chanki Moon](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chanki_Moon){target="_blank"}.

* The psychology of *social banditry*
* Organized crime
* Social Norms and Deviance
* Social Identity

Our research focuses on different geographical areas, including Italy, China, the UK, Korea and the US, and we can collect data from all these sites.

We keep a [lab notebook](/notebook/), where we propose analyses of recent topics, summarize research conducted by lab members, and comment on new data. Most posts are written in English, and some are in Italian.

Undergraduate and postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers who intend to conduct research in these and related areas are welcome to apply to join or visit the lab by [emailing](mailto:g.a.travaglino@kent.ac.uk) the director.
