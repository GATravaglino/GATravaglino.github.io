## CP&G Lab Director and Principal investigator

I joined the School of Psychology at the University of Kent in 2015 as Assistant Professor of Social and Organizational Psychology. I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Dominic Abrams and am currently an affiliated member of the Centre for the Study of Group Processes & Intergroup Relations. I have thought two years at the School of Humanities and Social Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). I funded [Contention](/contention) in 2012 and co-edit the journal now with Dr Benjamin Abrams.

### Research

My expertise is in the Social Psychology of Intergroup and Intragroup Processes, including Deviance and Crime, Cultural Psychology, Leadership and Collective Actions. My research has investigated in what circumstances people tend to punish (or forgive) transgressions from group members. Another line of my work has examined how cultural values enable criminal groups to gain legitimacy in society. My research has been funded by the ESRC, the British Academy
